We describe the case of a 12-year-old female patient who presented with a sudden intense headache while at home and without exertion. She was initially managed with oral paracetamol at home, and after 72 hours, she developed generalized tonic-clonic seizures and was transferred to the hospital, where she was stabilized with antiepileptics and analgesics. She immediately underwent a simple cranial tomography, which showed an intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the right frontal lobe and a subarachnoid hemorrhage in the interhemispheric fissure. The study was complemented with a CTA, showing a 12 mm bilobed saccular aneurysm in the anterior communicating artery, so she was evaluated by the pediatric neurosurgeon. The patient was awake, with a tendency to somnolence, reactive isochoric pupils (3 mm), without cranial nerve involvement, left body hemiparesis with strength 4/5. She presented the following scores: on the Glasgow Coma Scale, 12 points (O3, V4, M5); on the World Federation of Neurologic Surgeons scale (WFNS), grade IV; on the Hunt and Hess scale, grade 3, and on the Fisher scale, grade 4 (by tomography). Management was decided in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) to ensure stability, and clipping of the aneurysm was performed by right pterional craniotomy two weeks after the event. The patient was extubated 72 hours after the procedure and subsequently returned to the ward for continued management. On day 7, a postoperative CTA was performed, which showed adequate clipping and exclusion of the aneurysm. The patient was evaluated by Rheumatology, Cardiology, Neurology, Infectology, and Genetics, performing whole body CTA, echocardiography, bilateral renal ultrasound, and immunological tests. However, it was not possible to identify the etiology of the aneurysm. She was discharged on postoperative day 8 with an antiepileptic drug and resolution of symptoms. She is currently asymptomatic with outpatient follow-up.
