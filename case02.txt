Article 3
Mr Johnson is age 59 and presented to our institution with the “worst headache of his life,” and no other significant past medical history. His neurologic examination revealed no focal abnormalities. Laboratory test results, including platelet count and coagulation studies were within normal range. Mr Johnson’s head CT demonstrated a Hunt Hess grade 2, modified Fisher 3 subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A head CT-angiogram (CTA) demonstrated a 5-mm left pericallosal artery aneurysm. Antifibrinolytic therapy with aminocaproic acid was initiated, and Mr Johnson was scheduled for a catheter cerebral angiogram the following morning. Catheter angiography, including 3D spin revealed normal caliber anterior and posterior circulation vasculature, with no evidence for aneurysm, suggesting aneurysmal thrombosis had occurred. Mr Johnson was monitored for vasospasm and hydrocephalus during recovery in the neurology intensive care unit (neuroICU). He had a follow-up catheter angiogram 7 days later that demonstrated recanalization of the pericallosal artery aneurysm. Mr Johnson was taken to the operating room for open surgical aneurysmal clipping. Intraoperative visualization of the aneurysm confirmed the presence of persistent partial saccular thrombosis prior to permanent microsurgical clip obliteration. Postoperative care and recovery for Mr Johnson was uneventful, and he remained neurologically intact on follow-up 3 months after hospital discharge.
