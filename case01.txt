Article 2
A 54-year-old woman was presented with sudden onset of severe headache, vomiting and decreased conscious level. She was initially transported to a local hospital before she was referred to our hospital for management of subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). On admission, the patient was semi comatose with anisocoric pupils. The repeat computerized tomography (CT) scan and coronal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a dense SAH and intracerebral haematoma (ICH) (insular haematoma) in the right sylvian fissure with evidence of rebleeding. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) confirmed a saccular aneurysm of the M3 segment in the dMCA on the right side.  A right pterional–frontal craniotomy was performed. The sylvian fissure was partially opened and MCA division and its branch were exposed. A small sulcal opening was made on the discolorated cortical surface and haematoma was gently removed. A saccular aneurysm 12 mm in diameter was embedded within the haematoma cavity. The aneurysm originated from the M3 segment in the dMCA. The aneurysm was successfully obliterated with clip. Follow-up DSA obtained two weeks later confirmed total obliteration of the aneurysm and good patency of the dMCA. No postoperative complication was observed. The patient was neurologically intact at discharge. The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful and she was discharged home on the 14th postoperative day. At 2 months follow-up examination, she had recovered completely.
